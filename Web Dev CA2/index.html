                  Human sustainability
                  <br><br>
                  Human sustainability refers to the sustainment and improvement of human resources/assets or culture within society. 
                  Typically, this could be achieved through enablers such as investment in services or capacity covering areas such as:
                  <br><br>
                  Health, Education, Welfare, etc.
                  <br><br>
                  The Human sustainability pillar targets investment in skills that function to sustain or improve the well-being of society.
                  <br><br>
                  Social sustainability has a broader scope with a far-reaching view of the world we live in, accommodating communities, cultures, and concepts such as globalization. It also introduces the principle that society and the environment are mutually dependent.
                  The goal of social sustainability is two-fold:
                  <br><br>
                  Recognize that we have an impact on others and on the world by what we do.
                  To protect future generations.
                  <br><br>
                  You can see social sustainability encouraged through laws and regulations. For example, within business equality and rights policies, which aim to drive both social and economic equality.
                  <br><br>
                  Where Social and Human sustainability focus on human issues, economic sustainability focuses on monetary capital.
                  Economic sustainability is often described at a country or regional level.
                  <br><br>
                  It can be defined as the economic ability of a given country or region to support a specified level of economic production indefinitely.
                  <br><br>
                  Environmental sustainability aims to enhance the welfare of the population through the strength and stability of our natural capital.
                  Examples of natural capital include resources such as:
                  <br><br>
                  Fossil fuels, Land, Air, Water, Minerals, Solar Energy 
                  <br><br>
                  Environmental initiatives are commonplace and are usually one of the key terms people think of when thinking about sustainability.
